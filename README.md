In a campus recruitment training program, the code files in C language might include various exercises, assignments, or projects designed to improve programming skills and prepare students for technical interviews. Here's a typical breakdown of what these code files might include:

Basic Concepts and Syntax Exercises:

Files covering basic C syntax, data types, operators, and control structures (loops, conditionals).
Functions and Modules:

Programs demonstrating function definitions, parameter passing, return values, and modular programming concepts.
Arrays and Pointers:

Code files exploring array handling, multi-dimensional arrays, pointer arithmetic, and memory allocation.
Strings and Character Handling:

Examples focusing on string manipulation, character functions (like strlen, strcpy, strcmp), and handling input/output.
File Handling:

Exercises involving file operations such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
Structures and Unions:

Programs showcasing structures (structs), unions, and typedefs, emphasizing data organization and access.
Dynamic Memory Allocation:

Code demonstrating malloc, calloc, realloc, and free functions for memory management.
Sorting and Searching Algorithms:

Implementation of various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort) and searching techniques (linear search, binary search).
Data Structures:

Introduction to basic data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees (binary trees, binary search trees).
Advanced Topics:

Depending on the program's depth, files might cover advanced topics such as recursion, function pointers, bitwise operations, and error handling.
These files typically progress from simpler concepts to more complex ones, allowing students to build a solid foundation in C programming essential for technical interviews and real-world applications.
